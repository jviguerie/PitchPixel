# PitchPixel
PitchPixel is a real-time and post-processing application of OpenCV authored in Python (Win-7).

The intended usage is to enhance youth pitcher training with a VR/AR-like experience.
Watch the videos in the repository to get the idea.

So far I've failed to get the PitchPixel python-opencv working on mobile (android or iOs).
Ideally the python-opencv basic code can be optimized to mobile.
